# Plan: A Hardware Ray-Traced Renderer for Minecraft (Java, 26.2 / Vulkan)

Status: **P0–P4 complete** (2026-06-17). P3 path-traced lighting GPU-verified; P4 DLSS Ray
Reconstruction working — render-res split + sub-pixel jitter, vanilla renders full res while the path
tracer runs at `-Dupscaler.rt.renderScale` and DLSS-RR upscales to display. The P4.2b jitter bugs are
fixed: motion vectors are now jitter-free (subtract the jittered ndc) and the reported `InJitterOffset`
is negated, both validated against `mcvr-ref`. **The renderer is now DLSS-RR-only** — the legacy FSR
and DLSS Super-Resolution rasterizer paths and the P0 triangle self-test were deleted (compatibility /
vendor-agnostic denoiser fallback deferred to the end; recoverable from git history). **Next: P5
(dynamic content — entities/block-entities as rigid cuboid instances + per-object motion vectors).**
Supersedes the "augment Sodium for RT" approach in `sodium-26.2-beta/RENDER_API_PLAN.md` (Phases 3–4
there). The upscaler work in `dlss-mod/` (`UPSCALER_PLAN.md`) is reused as the denoise/upscale backend.
Validated against prior art: **Radiance** (Java/Fabric) + its C++ engine **MCVR**,
both studied 2026-06-14 (see "Prior art" below) — local checkouts `radiance-ref/`,
`mcvr-ref/`.

**Progress (2026-06-17):** Implemented through **P4** inside `dlss-mod` (package `dev.upscaler.rt`,
step-tagged commits on `main`; run flags + internals in the `rt-renderer-p0` auto-memory). P3 + P4
notes are below; P0–P2 detail follows.

- **P0 complete** — device bring-up → AS → RT pipeline/SBT → on-screen triangle.
- **P1 complete** — on-screen, camera-driven, **textured** terrain with **biome tint** (resolved
  from `BlockColors`/`BlockTintSource`, unlit), **alpha-cutout foliage/glass** (native any-hit), and
  **real ray-traced AO + hard sun shadows**: the primary closest-hit returns a deferred G-buffer
  (albedo/normal/hitT) and raygen traces secondary visibility rays — one sun shadow + a 16-sample
  cosine hemisphere for sky-visibility AO (the "real AO for free" milestone). Iterative-in-raygen
  (no closest-hit recursion → `maxRayRecursionDepth` 1); shadow/AO rays use a 2nd SBT miss shader
  (`shadow.rmiss`, missIndex 1) with `TerminateOnFirstHit | SkipClosestHit`.
- **P2 complete** — section-based residency synced to vanilla's loaded chunks (render-distance
  window polled per tick, gated by `hasChunk`), block-edit dirty rebuilds via a `LevelExtractor`
  hook, per-section BLAS with section-local vertices + a BDA section table
  (`{primAddr, idxAddr, uvAddr}` indexed by `gl_InstanceCustomIndexEXT`), camera-relative TLAS
  rebases (rebase = player block per rebuild), and **fully async builds**: one build in flight at a
  time (prepare → `submitAsync` → poll fence → swap), a 3-slot descriptor-set ring so the TLAS
  rebinds without a device drain, and a frames-in-flight-safe deferred-free queue. Zero drains on the
  render hot path; fly far from origin without leaks / corruption / precision cracks.

**Deviations from the plan below:** extraction uses vanilla `ModelBlockRenderer` (not the Sodium
mesher tap); residency + dirty tracking are driven by `hasChunk` polling + a
`LevelExtractor.setBlocksDirty` inject (renderer-agnostic, coexists with Sodium's `@Overwrite`),
not Sodium internals; the TLAS is rebuilt **on geometry change** (load/unload/edit/rebase), not
literally every frame — the per-frame `camOffset` push constant absorbs intra-rebuild camera
motion; async builds run on the **graphics queue** (async submit, not a secondary queue) with
simple nearest-first ordering + a per-tick budget (no distance/staleness scheduler yet). Geometry
is kept **double-sided** (no back-face cull) with a viewer-facing normal flip. AO is single-frame
(per-pixel-stable grain) until the P4 denoiser.

**Deferred P1 polish:** grass cross-model z-fight dedup, fluids (water/lava), and alpha-tested
cutout shadows (shadow/AO rays currently force-opaque → foliage casts solid shadows).

## Thesis

Build a **parallel Vulkan renderer that consumes vanilla world data and replaces
the world-rendering stage** — not RT effects bolted onto the rasterizer, and not a
reimplementation of Minecraft.

The decision to drop Sodium as the render base (decided 2026-06-13, after shipping
the DLSS/FSR upscaler):
- Sodium's value is **culling what the camera can't see** (occlusion/back-face
  culling, draw batching). RT **needs what the camera can't see** — off-screen
  geometry for reflections, back-faces for shadows, distant geometry for GI. The
  core optimization is antithetical to RT.
- Sodium's geometry is rasterization-shaped (20-bit packed positions needing an AS
  decode, no PBR material channel, region-batched). Every RT feature fights it.
- The renderer must be replaced wholesale for a path tracer anyway (HDR, compute/RT
  pipelines, denoise) — that's not a Sodium addition.
- The pains hit while building the upscaler were all symptoms of bolting RT-shaped
  needs onto an LDR rasterizer: entity motion vectors (fighting vanilla entity
  rasterization), DLSS exposure (no real HDR/exposure to provide). Both dissolve
  when we own the renderer.

Note: "drop Sodium as the **render base**" is about its render/culling path, not its
meshing code. Borrowing Sodium's block→quad *mesher* as an extraction scaffold (below)
is a separate, pragmatic tactical choice and does not contradict this.

## Prior art: Radiance / MCVR — this has been shipped (on GL)

[Radiance](https://github.com/Minecraft-Radiance/Radiance) (Fabric, MC 1.21.4) + its
C++ engine [MCVR](https://github.com/Minecraft-Radiance/MCVR) already ship **hardware-RT
path tracing for Java Minecraft**: DLSS-RR/FSR3/XeSS/NRD, LabPBR + Disney BRDF, ReSTIR
direct light, SHARC GI, volumetrics, FFT water. So this is **proven possible, not novel
as a concept** — drop any "first ever" framing. Two strategic takeaways:

1. **Their architecture is the "standalone replacement on GL" we contrasted — and its
   cost is visible in the code.** Because vanilla is GL, MCVR stands up its *own*
   VkInstance/device/swapchain (volk + glfw + VMA) and Radiance must re-route *all* of
   Blaze3D into it: **50 `vulkan_render_integration` + 17 `vanilla_resource_tracker`
   mixins (67 total) + ~12 JNI proxy classes** reimplementing the whole GL pipeline on
   Vulkan dynamic state (`PipelineStateProxy`: blend/depth/stencil/cull/scissor/viewport),
   buffers, shader translation (`ShaderTranslator`), textures, and the window. They even
   render **UI/text/particles/hand** inside their RT pipeline (`text.rahit`, `render_text`,
   `world_post_text`, `hand.rmiss`). **That whole layer is the GL tax — exactly what
   riding vanilla's Vulkan device deletes.** Our mixin surface is the world seam +
   geometry extraction + RT extensions; vanilla keeps drawing UI/hand into the shared
   target. This is our real differentiator, not novelty.
2. **We use FFM; they use JNI + `sun.misc.Unsafe`.** Their `WindowsTraps.txt`/README
   document the JDK-bundled `msvcp140.dll`/`vcruntime140.dll` crash and the
   `long`-is-32-bit-on-Windows trap — JNI-boundary pains our Java-25 FFM stack avoids.

**Design choices MCVR validates (we converge):** RT pipeline + SBT (`.rgen/.rchit/
.rahit/.rmiss` + `sbt.cpp`), per-section BLAS, `VK_GEOMETRY_OPAQUE_BIT` for solid blocks
vs `NO_DUPLICATE_ANY_HIT_INVOCATION` for cutouts, ReSTIR for emitter-dense direct light,
ray cones for texture LOD (`ray_cone.glsl`), LabPBR ingestion.
**Where MCVR goes further than our draft:** GI via a **SHARC radiance cache**
(`sharc_resolve.comp`, not brute-force bounce count); a **separate position buffer**
(`R32G32B32_SFLOAT`) split from a fat **material buffer**, both addressed by BDA in hit
shaders; **integer section coords + a sliding-window grid origin** (`chunkStorageSectionPos`)
for precision *and* AS memory; **batched, async BLAS builds** on a secondary queue with a
**distance+staleness priority scheduler** (`Chunk1::buildFactor`, `D_HALF=128` blocks),
version-based dirty tracking, and a **deferred resource retainer** for frames-in-flight-safe
frees. **Where we differ deliberately:** they reuse vanilla's mesher (we scaffold from
Sodium's); they target AMD too so use **no SER** — `VK_NV_ray_tracing_invocation_reorder`
is an NVIDIA/Blackwell-only edge available to us.

## Layer boundaries (what we keep vs. replace)

| Layer | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Game / world sim (block states, chunk data, entity pos+animation, ticks, resource packs) | **Consume vanilla as-is** | Enormous, not our value-add, RT still needs all of it |
| Geometry extraction (world+entities → GPU geometry + materials) | **Borrow Sodium's block→quad mesher as a temporary scaffold; emit an RT-native vertex format** | Sodium already does the hard part (model resolution, cullface, fluids) fast and threaded; we tap its quad sink, write `(section-local pos, normal, UV, materialID)`, and skip AO/compaction. Replace with a clean RT-native extractor later if fork-tracking hurts |
| Renderer (shading → pixels) | **Replace entirely** with a Vulkan RT renderer | Path tracing has nothing in common with Blaze3D rasterization |
| Frame composite (world → UI/hand) | **Reuse the existing seam** | `WorldRenderScaler`-style: our renderer fills the world target, vanilla UI/hand draw on top |

We consume vanilla **data**; we own the **renderer**. We never rebuild the game.

## Data we need from vanilla

- **Block geometry**: vanilla `BakedModel` quads per block state (positions, UVs,
  tint index, face, cullface, light emission). This is the authoritative source — but
  we reach it via Sodium's mesher (which already walks it correctly and fast) rather
  than re-implementing the traversal, tapping the quad sink and emitting our format.
- **Biome tint** (grass/foliage/water color) — applied during vanilla meshing via
  `BlockColors`; we consume it as an albedo modulation (it's the block's real color,
  not a fake). **We do NOT replicate vanilla's baked AO** — ray-traced sky/contact
  visibility gives us real AO, which is the entire point of owning a path tracer.
- **Block light emission** (`BlockState.getLightEmission`) for the emitter table.
- **Entity/block-entity geometry**: vanilla entity models (`EntityModel`,
  `ModelPart` cuboids) + per-frame pose. These are **rigid cuboid hierarchies, not
  skinned meshes** — instance rigid boxes with per-part transforms (see P5).
- **Atlas textures**: the block/item atlas (`TextureAtlas`) for albedo; sampled in
  hit shaders by UV.
- **Camera**: position (double), view rotation, FOV, near/far — we already pull
  these (`cameraRenderState`). The double position is load-bearing for precision.
- **PBR resource pack** (LabPBR-style): normal/roughness/metallic/emissive/SSS
  channels. Required for real PBR; without one, fall back to heuristics
  (albedo-derived roughness, emission from the light table).

## The renderer pipeline (per frame)

1. **Geometry residency**: maintain RT-native buffers for loaded chunks. Split a
   **position-only buffer** (`R32G32B32_SFLOAT`, section-local) consumed by the BLAS
   from a **fat material buffer** (normal, UV, tint, materialID) fetched in hit shaders
   — both reached by **buffer device address** via a per-chunk lookup (MCVR's pattern:
   `chunk_lookup.glsl` + per-chunk index/position/material BDA arrays). Dirty chunks
   re-extracted off-thread.
2. **AS management**: one BLAS per chunk section (compacted, static between edits;
   `OPAQUE` flag for solid blocks, `NO_DUPLICATE_ANY_HIT_INVOCATION` for cutouts);
   per-entity BLAS (refit per frame). One TLAS rebuilt per frame from in-range
   instances. **Build BLAS batched and async** on a secondary queue (one shared scratch
   buffer per batch), prioritized by **camera distance + staleness** (cf. MCVR
   `Chunk1::buildFactor`), with version-based dirty tracking and a **deferred resource
   retainer** so frees wait out frames-in-flight. Sliding-window grid over loaded
   chunks; AS memory budget.
   **Coordinate precision (camera-relative):** chunk identity is **integer section
   coords** against a **sliding-window grid origin** (MCVR `chunkStorageSectionPos`),
   and BLAS vertices are stored *section-local* (small → f32-exact); each frame's TLAS
   instance transform is `sectionOrigin − cameraPos` computed in **double** then narrowed
   to float — the same trick vanilla uses so an absolute 30M-block coordinate never
   reaches f32. Because the TLAS is already rebuilt per frame, this rebasing is free.
3. **Ray dispatch** (`VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline` — raygen/miss/closest-hit/any-hit
   + a Shader Binding Table): primary visibility straight into path tracing. Drive the
   path tracer as an **iterative loop in raygen** (trace → read payload → continue),
   not recursion from closest-hit, to keep the stack shallow at high bounce counts.
   Native **any-hit** handles alpha-tested cutouts; on Blackwell, **Shader Execution
   Reordering** (`VK_NV_ray_tracing_invocation_reorder`) cuts the divergence cost of
   incoherent bounce/material rays. Raw Vulkan — Blaze3D has no compute/RT, so own
   SPIR-V + pipelines created against `vkDevice()`.
4. **Lighting / path tracing**: GI is not a separate subsystem — same trace loop, more
   bounces. But "just raise the bounce count" is too noisy/expensive at real-time sample
   budgets: MCVR (a shipped product) uses **ReSTIR for direct light** (reservoirs +
   spatial/temporal reuse + precomputed light neighborhoods — for emitter-dense caves)
   and a **SHARC radiance cache for GI** (`sharc_resolve.comp`) rather than brute-force
   multi-bounce. So: NEE + MIS, Russian-roulette termination, firefly clamping, ReSTIR DI,
   and a radiance cache (SHARC) for indirect. Accumulate radiance in **HDR**. (A simple
   brute-force "vanilla-pt" loop is still the right *first* lit milestone — MCVR ships
   both a `vanilla-pt` and an `advanced` tier; we follow the same simple→advanced split.)
5. **Denoise + temporal + upscale**: **DLSS Ray Reconstruction** (denoise+upscale in
   one) as the NVIDIA path; **SVGF** (with blue-noise) + temporal accumulation, or
   **NRD**, as the vendor-agnostic fallback; then DLSS-SR / FSR3 / **XeSS** for upscale.
   (MCVR ships all of these as swappable modules.) Reuse `dlss-mod`'s NGX/FFX plumbing.
   We generate motion vectors and HDR ourselves, so jitter/MV/exposure are clean and owned.
6. **Tonemap** HDR → LDR, output to the world target.
7. **Composite**: vanilla hand/UI draw on top (existing seam).

## Vulkan requirements

Device extensions (added via the proven device-negotiation hook — same mechanism
that enabled the NGX/FFX extensions): `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`,
`VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline` (committed — we drive shading through the SBT, not ray
query), `VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations`, `VK_KHR_buffer_device_address`, and
`VK_NV_ray_tracing_invocation_reorder` (SER, Blackwell), plus the pNext feature
structs. The RTX 5070 Ti supports all of these; MC's device can be extended exactly
as we did for NGX.

## What transfers from the upscaler work (reuse, don't rebuild)

- **The NGX/FFX plumbing** (`dlss-mod` `ngx/`, `ffx/`, the C shim, FFM bindings,
  device-extension negotiation). RT is noisy and expensive → temporal denoise+upscale
  is mandatory, not optional. **DLSS Ray Reconstruction** is the natural denoiser —
  but note it's a *distinct NGX feature* (`RayReconstruction`/DLSSD), not the
  SuperSampling feature we shipped: the extension/FFM/shim plumbing is reused verbatim,
  but the feature path is new and demands extra **guide buffers** (separated diffuse/
  specular albedo, world normals, roughness, hit distance) we must generate correctly.
  The exposure problem disappears: we own HDR and feed a real exposure.
- **Device-extension negotiation** (Sodium Phase 0 / the standalone
  `VulkanBackendMixin`) — needed verbatim for the RT extensions.
- **The world-composite seam** (`WorldRenderScaler` / `GameRendererMixin`): the
  integration model is identical — fill the world target, UI/hand on top. Swap
  "rasterize at low res + upscale" for "ray trace + denoise + upscale."
- **All Vulkan interop plumbing** learned: raw command buffers via the encoder
  accessor, VMA images, barriers, `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` policy, the crash-
  sentinel/dev-loop workflow.

What does *not* transfer: the original RT plan's "BLAS from Sodium arenas, Sodium
owns the TLAS." We own geometry, so we own the AS. (We borrow Sodium's mesher *code*
to fill our own buffers — we do not consume its packed/culled render output.)

## Phased plan (each phase ends at a visible, testable milestone)

- **P0 — RT bring-up.** ✅ Done. Register RT device extensions; confirm support; stand up a
  minimal `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline` (raygen + miss + closest-hit) with a **Shader
  Binding Table** and trace a hardcoded triangle BVH into a texture shown on screen.
  Validates the raw-VK RT pipeline + SBT + SPIR-V + device negotiation. (Mirrors the
  FSR stage-1 spike; the SBT is the one genuinely fiddly bit — budget for it here.)
- **P1 — Sky-lit static terrain.** ✅ Done (extended past the original spec with biome tint, any-hit
  cutout, and sun shadows; extraction via vanilla `ModelBlockRenderer` rather than the Sodium tap).
  Extract loaded chunk geometry by **borrowing
  Sodium's block→quad mesher** (tap its quad sink; emit section-local pos, normal, UV,
  materialID; AO/compaction off) → per-section BLAS → camera-relative TLAS → trace
  primary rays → shade `albedo × skyVisibility`, where the **miss shader returns a
  constant sky** and a cosine sky-visibility ray gives **real AO for free**. No vanilla
  AO/tint parity — this is a path-traced look, not a vanilla impersonation. Borrowing
  Sodium's mesher means all model shapes + fluids come along for free, so this is the
  full pipeline-validating spike (extraction, AS, SBT shading, compositing, real
  precision) without rebuilding a mesher. **The go/no-go proof.**
- **P2 — Geometry lifecycle.** ✅ Done (async builds, descriptor-set ring, deferred frees; TLAS
  rebuilt on change rather than per-frame). Chunk load/unload/edit → BLAS create/refit/free;
  per-frame TLAS with camera-relative rebasing; AS memory budget + sliding window over
  render distance. Goal: fly around (including far from world origin) without leaks,
  corruption, or precision cracks.
- **P3 — Path-traced lighting.** ✅ Done (GPU-verified). Brute-force "vanilla-pt" lit pass: NEE +
  MIS, Russian roulette, firefly clamping; sun/sky + emissive from the block light table; HDR
  accumulation. ReSTIR DI + SHARC GI deferred to a later optimization pass (P3.3). Temporal
  accumulation was removed once DLSS-RR owned temporal reuse (1 spp + per-frame seed).
- **P4 — Denoise + temporal + upscale.** ✅ Done. **DLSS Ray Reconstruction** as a *new* NGX feature
  path (guide buffers: diffuse/specular albedo, world normals, roughness packed in normal.w, linear
  hit distance, render-res motion vectors); render-res trace → RR denoise+upscale to display; HDR
  tonemap in `blend.comp`. Jitter (Halton, applied to the primary ray in `world.rgen`, reported
  negated to RR) and jitter-free MVs validated against `mcvr-ref`. **Implementation is DLSS-RR-only**:
  the FSR/DLSS-SR rasterizer paths were removed; the SVGF/NRD/FSR/XeSS vendor-agnostic fallback in
  step 5 above is deferred to the end of the project. Exposure: AutoExposure (fixed-exposure A/B is a
  P-final tuning item). Goal met: clean real-time image at ~1/4 the ray work.
- **P5 — Dynamic content.** ← in progress. Entity/block-entity geometry as **rigid cuboid instances**
  (`ModelPart` boxes are rigid, not skinned — instance a unit-cube BLAS per part, or
  refit a per-entity BLAS only on pose change; cheap even with many mobs) + per-frame
  motion vectors (owned, so MV is clean); water/translucency (refraction); foliage
  alpha-test via native **any-hit**.
  - **P5.1a — dynamic per-frame TLAS plumbing (in working tree; compiles; NOT yet GPU-verified).**
    The traced TLAS moved out of `RtTerrain` (which still builds the section BLAS async) into a
    **per-frame rebuild recorded inline in the composite's frame command buffer**: `RtTerrain` now
    publishes a static-instance list (`staticInstances()`) + the section table; `RtComposite` each
    frame does `prepareTlas(staticInstances)` → `setTlas` → `recordTlasBuild` → AS-build→trace barrier
    → trace, retiring the frame TLAS `KEEP_FRAMES` later via a deferred-free queue. The descriptor ring
    grew to 6 (per-frame rebind cycles a slot every frame; must exceed frames-in-flight). De-risking
    milestone: **terrain image unchanged, no leaks/corruption flying around** — the foundation entities
    (P5.1b) and per-object MVs (P5.1c) build on.
- **P6 — PBR materials.** LabPBR resource-pack ingestion (normal/roughness/metallic/
  emissive/SSS) + proper BRDF. Heuristic fallback when no PBR pack.
- **P7 — Perf & polish.** AS compaction, SER tuning, texture-LOD via ray cones,
  distant-geometry LOD or hybrid far-field, variable sample counts, settings UI.

P0–P1 alone prove the whole concept. P4 is where it becomes real-time-viable.

## Hard problems specific to Minecraft RT (called out early)

- **Infinite world / AS memory**: can't BVH the whole world. Sliding window of
  loaded-chunk BLAS + per-frame TLAS; budget VRAM; far-field LOD or hybrid (RT near,
  cheaper far). The dominant scaling problem.
- **Coordinate precision**: f32 can't hold absolute world coords (±30M). Solved the
  same way vanilla does — **camera-relative**: section-local BLAS vertices + a
  `sectionOrigin − cameraPos` (double→float) TLAS instance transform per frame. Never
  let an absolute coordinate reach f32.
- **Chunk-edit churn**: block changes → re-extract + rebuild BLAS. We own the
  extraction, so dirty-tracking is clean — but block updates can be frequent.
- **Foliage / cutout**: alpha-tested leaves/grass need **any-hit shaders** to
  discard transparent texels — correct but a per-ray cost.
- **Water / glass / translucency**: refraction + ordered transparency in a path
  tracer; water surface normals/animation.
- **Texture LOD in hit shaders**: no hardware mip derivatives along a ray — naive
  mip-0 atlas sampling moirés on distant blocks. Need **ray-cone / ray-differential**
  LOD plus careful atlas mip + sprite-bleed handling.
- **Materials**: vanilla has only albedo (+ tint). Real PBR needs a resource pack;
  otherwise heuristic roughness/metalness like shaderpacks do.
- **Special-cased / procedural models**: some blocks don't survive generic extraction.
  Radiance *ships replacement models* for `redstone_dust_*` and `grass_block` and has
  dedicated hit shaders for `end_portal`/`end_gateway` — expect per-block handling for
  connected/tinted wire, procedural/animated, and view-dependent blocks.
- **Emissive mapping**: which blocks emit and how much (lava/glowstone/torches) —
  from the light-emission table and/or PBR emissive channel. Many emitters per scene →
  needs a light structure (grid/alias table, then ReSTIR), not uniform sampling.
- **Entity geometry**: `ModelPart` cuboids are **rigid boxes, not skinned meshes** —
  instance a unit-cube BLAS per part with per-part transforms, or refit a per-entity
  BLAS only on pose change. Far cheaper than the skinned framing; "many mobs" is a
  TLAS-instance-count problem, not a per-vertex skinning one.
- **Biome tint**: applied in vanilla meshing (`BlockColors`); consume it as albedo.
  (We do *not* replicate baked AO — sky-visibility rays give real AO.)
- **Sky / atmosphere**: physical sky model or sampling vanilla's sky for the miss
  shader and sun direction.
- **RT debugging / TDR**: heavy path-tracing dispatches can trip Windows' 2 s GPU
  watchdog (device-lost) — split work / raise `TdrDelay`. Use Nsight Graphics for AS
  inspection + the AS validation layers; capture GPU crash dumps for device-lost. The
  SBT is the most error-prone surface — validate it early.

## Integration shape

A new Fabric client mod (own repo, e.g. `mc-rt`), reusing `dlss-mod`'s `ngx/`+`ffx/`
packages (extract to a shared module, or depend on it). Mixins limited to: the
world-render seam (take over the world target), device creation (RT extensions),
and data access (atlas, baked models, entity render states, camera) — **not** the
67-mixin GL-translation surface Radiance needed, because vanilla already renders
UI/hand/particles into the Vulkan target we share. Native interop is **FFM (Java 25),
no JNI** — sidestepping Radiance's `msvcp140`/`vcruntime140` JDK-runtime crash class.
Geometry extraction borrows Sodium's mesher as a scaffold; everything else is our own
Vulkan code against `vkDevice()`. A toggle to fall back to vanilla/Sodium rasterization
when RT is off or unsupported.

## Scope & effort

The DLSS+FSR upscaler (~1-day) was *integration of two prebuilt SDKs over an existing
renderer* — there was a signed DLL to bind. This project **is** the renderer: an
extractor, AS lifecycle, the full RT-pipeline + SBT + path-tracing shaders, a sampling/
lighting system, and a denoiser integration. There's no SDK to bind, so the upscaler's
velocity does not transfer past bring-up. Realistic shape:
- **P0** (RT-pipeline + SBT bring-up): days. The SBT is the fiddly part; the triangle
  trace itself is quick.
- **P1** (sky-lit terrain): genuinely near-term *because* we borrow Sodium's mesher
  instead of rebuilding one — the model-shape/fluid long tail comes for free. This is
  the go/no-go proof and the first thing worth screenshotting.
- **P2–P4** (lifecycle → path-traced lighting → denoised real-time): the substantial
  middle. Architecture is small (one bounce-parameterized loop); the time goes into
  sampling quality (NEE/MIS/ReSTIR), denoiser guide-buffer correctness, and tuning.
- **P5–P7** (dynamic content, PBR, perf): long-tail polish that never fully ends.

Still the largest thing in this workspace by an order of magnitude over the upscaler.
This is **not novel** — Radiance/MCVR shipped hardware-RT path tracing for Java MC. Our
differentiator is the **integration model**: a co-tenant on vanilla's Vulkan device that
skips the ~67-mixin GL-translation layer Radiance needed on GL, via FFM rather than JNI.
Radiance is also the honest effort yardstick — a two-repo engine with ReSTIR/SHARC/
volumetrics/multiple denoisers is months of work; we save the GL layer, not the RT engine.

## Immediate next step

P0–P4 are done (see Progress); the renderer is DLSS-RR-only. **P5 — dynamic content** is next:
entity/block-entity geometry as **rigid cuboid instances** (`ModelPart` boxes are rigid, not skinned
— instance a unit-cube BLAS per part, or refit a per-entity BLAS only on pose change) with **per-frame
per-object motion vectors** (extending P4's owned MV/guide-buffer infra), plus water/translucency
(refraction) and any remaining cutout polish. Sequencing rationale: dynamic entities animate the TLAS
every frame, so this is gated on the real denoiser P4 just delivered.

Smaller deferred items that can slot in anytime: **grass cross-model dedup** (collapse coincident
`cross` quads to kill the z-fight); the **ReSTIR DI + SHARC GI** quality pass (P3.3); a
**vendor-agnostic denoiser/upscaler fallback** (SVGF/NRD + FSR/XeSS) and a non-RTX path — explicitly
deferred to the end of the project; and DLSS-RR fine-tuning (RR preset sweep, fixed-exposure A/B vs
AutoExposure, jitter-sign reconfirm via the dev DLL).
